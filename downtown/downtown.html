	<h2>Why Downtown Dallas?</h2>
	</header>
	
	<p>
	<strong><em>Downtown Dallas</em></strong> is a continuously growing area with a beautiful arts scene, urban green spaces, fine dining and luxurious shopping. See the hustle and bustle of professionals by day, and experience nightlife and entertainment after dark.<br><br>
	Experience the <em>history</em> of Dallas on the West End of Downtown. Here you will find the Old Red Museum where the visitorâ€™s center is held. You can also learn more about the history of Dallas visiting <a href="../oed/oldeastdallas.html">Old East Dallas</a>.<br><br>
	You will also find the John F. Kennedy Memorial Plaza. There is a ton of shops and restaurants located on a walking strip of Market and Record Streets.<br><br>
	The Dallas Farmers Market is also found in Downtown Dallas. Historically, it was the central hub for farmers to bring their produce, meats, and dairy to the city.<br><br>
	Today, with the development in downtown Dallas, the Dallas Farmers Market has been transformed to be the farmers market for the future. The addition of food entrepreneurs along with farmers and ranchers, makes this a place to taste the diverse flavors and cultures of Texas.<br><br>
